    "For this task, the company **\"GCETtech\"** have enlisted your support as a security data analyst. They suspect some kind of attack on their web server application, however they are unable to diagnose what has happened exactly, or which of their users have caused the attack. The company have provided you with their recent log data records. You will need to complete a series of tasks to examine the data further, and then expand your investigation to uncover any malicious activity.\n",

    "**Dataset**: You will be randomly issued a **unique dataset** based on your UWE username - **failure to use the dataset assigned to your username will result in a zero grade**. Please see the folder ***\"Portfolio Assignment\"*** under the Assignment tab on Moodle for further detail related to the access and download of the necessary dataset.\n",

Each question states the possible marks available for a correct answer. Where a question is worth more than 1 mark, a partial solution to the question may warrant partial marks.\n",
